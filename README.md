## Overview

With a Raspberry Pi gateway, you can collect data from RS-485 devices such as temperature and humidity sensors and door sensors to achieve remote control of relay actions.

## Get started

### Prerequisites

```sh
Python3.0
```

### Compile the code
```sh
PyCharm 2021.2.3
```

### Run the demo
```sh
new_temp_hum_door.py
```

### Other


Two demos are used to build a Raspberry Pi gateway. One demo in Python works for communication with RS-485 devices. The other demo in C works for communication with the [Tuya IoT Development Platform](https://iot.tuya.com/).
